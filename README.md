==============

a particularly slow and inflexible population genetic forward simulator


---


Applicability
-------------

- constant population size
- haploid only
- selection allowed
- recombination allowed
- mutation allowed
- only two alleles per site
- only two sites per genome
- only symmetric compensatory selection


Features
--------

- tracks haplotype distribution by state at each generation
- tracks haplotype in ancestral lineage for site 1 at each generation
- tracks haplotype in ancestral lineage for site 2 at each generation
- tracks whether or not the site 1 and site 2 ancestral lineages
  are in the same haploid at each generation


Other limitations
-----------------

- slow algorithm
- slow implementation
